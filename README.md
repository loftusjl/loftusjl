This is my personal portfolio site.

Currently I'm working on building a new version in Gatsby when I have the time. The plan is to give it both mouse driven and "CLI" driven functionality.

The branch `feature/reactBaseline` is where I got to before deciding to do it in Gatsby. The Gatsby version will go with a similar look and feel.
